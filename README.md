- running against selenium/chromedriver server on port 4444 (can use locally as well)
- Test sortable table

Note: This is imcomplete according to doc requirements. There is a lot of room for improvement as well. I did not have as much time as I had hoped.


## Getting Up and Running Locally

- From project root run `./start_server.sh`
- In a different terminal window or tab run `mix test`
